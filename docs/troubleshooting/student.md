# Student Troubleshooting

- Issue: Can't message Admin or Class Teacher
  Cause: Student chat limited to Admin and assigned Class Teacher.
  Fix: Open the chat on your profile; choose one recipient. Ensure your class assignment is set.

- Issue: Fee payment not reflecting
  Cause: M-Pesa test number not linked or no current term assignment.
  Fix: Confirm your phone matches the registered one and that a fee is assigned for the current term.

- Issue: Can't see exam results
  Cause: Results not published or permissions limited.
  Fix: Ask your teacher/admin to publish results and grant access.
