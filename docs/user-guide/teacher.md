# Teacher Guide

## Dashboard
- View timetable and upcoming events (FullCalendar via `/dashboard/events/json/`).

## Exams and Results
- Enter scores (respect grading scheme limits if enforced by admin).
- View class result slips via `teacher_class_result_slip` (all students in the class).

## Messaging
- Chat with admins, students, or parents (basic one-on-one).

## Tips
- If a dropdown (e.g., Term) is empty, ensure data exists (Terms must be created first).

## Troubleshooting
- For common teacher issues (calendar empty, messaging recipients not loading, result slip access), see:
  - [Teacher Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/teacher.md)
