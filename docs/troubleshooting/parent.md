# Parent/Guardian Troubleshooting

- Issue: Fee balance looks incorrect
  Cause: Missing latest payments or wrong student mapping.
  Fix: Sync payments (M-Pesa reconciliation), verify the student's phone/parent contact matches school records.

- Issue: Cannot message school
  Cause: Messaging feature may be limited by role.
  Fix: Use the parent messaging page if enabled; otherwise contact admin to enable parent messaging.

- Issue: No access to student results
  Cause: Access controlled by admin/teacher.
  Fix: Request access or wait for results to be released.
